    I will tell you a little about myself and what you can find here :)
    AKS - why AKS?
    Because those are my initials - Aurelija Klimaite Stankeviciene.
    And the design - because  is my own design.
    Simple and convenient.

   I am a mother of two children, so my profession - seamstress - is very important to me.
      Children grow very quickly and need new clothes all the time, and when mom knows how to sew - its not a problem!
      My goal is not only to decorate my children, but also yours. Therefore, many of my works are intended for children,
      although I also sew for adults.'
