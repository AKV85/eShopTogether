    I will briefly introduce myself and what you can find here :)
    AKS - why AKS? Because they are my initials - Aurelija Klimaite Stankeviciene.
    And the design - its my own original desig. simple and convenient.
    I am a mother of two, and my profession is quite relevant for me - a seamstress.
      the kids are growing up fast and always need new clothes, and since the mother can sew - it isnt a problem!
      My goal isnt just to adorn my kids, but Yours as well. Which is why much of my work is dedicated for chlidren,
      thought I also sew for adults too. '
